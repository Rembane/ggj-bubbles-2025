# Wizards Bubble Down like Frobscottle
You're a wizard in a bubble set on getting to the bottom of this

Played with a controller:  
Steer with left joystick  
Cross to dash  
Triangle to reset to your checkpoint  
Hold down left bumper to cling to surfaces  
Hold down right bumper while touching (or clinging to) a surface to set your checkpoint there  
Options closes the game  

You can only dash twice before you need to touch a surface again, and you can only cling for a little while before you need to dash again. Speed is key! Try to get to the bottom as quickly as possible.

HINTS:
It's easier to move along a surface while clinging to it  
Corners are real weird
